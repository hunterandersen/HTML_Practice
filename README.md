# Steps to Practice

1. Open VS Code
1. Create an `index.html` file
1. Type an `!`
    - Typing that `!` should have brought up a little dropdown menu that says "Emmet Abbreviation" towards the right side. That's good. Press `tab`
    - Pressing `tab` should generate a lot of code for you. Everything from `<html>` tags to `<body>` tags and a lot in between!
1. Write out the rest of the file in that space between the `<body> </body>` tags
    - Pay extra close attention to all the details
    - Things like `<`, `>`, `:`, `;`, `.`, `/`, `{`, and `}` are <strong>all important</strong>
    - The order and the accuracy of what we type in programming is crucial
