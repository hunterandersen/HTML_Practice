# Steps to Practice

1. Open a new folder in VS Code
1. Create an `index.html` file
1. Within that `index.html` file type an `!`
    - Typing that `!` should have brought up a little dropdown menu that says "Emmet Abbreviation" towards the right side. That's good. Press `tab`
    - Pressing `tab` should generate a lot of code for you. Everything from `<html>` tags to `<body>` tags and a lot in between!
1. Now you're ready to copy the rest of this sample file into your file
1. Manually write out the rest of this sample file in that space between the `<body> </body>` tags
1. This is your chance to practice the mechanics of typing out all the strange new syntax and reinforce what we've been learning in class. I promise taking this time now will help you tremendously moving forward.
    - Pay extra close attention to all the details
    - Things like `<`, `>`, `:`, `;`, `.`, `/`, `{`, and `}` are <strong>all important</strong>
    - The order and the accuracy of what we type in programming is crucial
